# Local Culture Deserves Better Infrastructure

- Events are scattered across platforms.
- Organizers post everywhere, reach no one.
- Communities miss what matters most.

**Togather** is a collaboration for the future of events data. We are making a data commons for open events ecosystems.

## Our Opportunity

We're at an inflection point. AI agents are emerging as personal assistants that can help people discover, evaluate, and plan events. We can build open infrastructure so local, open source, privacy-first software can help *you*, rather than algorithms optimizing for engagement and ads.

This changes everything. What if event discovery worked like the internet *should*?

- **Personal AI curators**: Agents that learn your taste, coordinate with your calendar, and surface events you'd actually love
- **No platform lock-in**: Publish once, appear everywhere (calendar apps, websites, feeds, your audience's inbox)
- **Privacy by default**: Personal curators run locally or through trusted instances. No tracking, no profiling
- **Open and improvable**: All code is inspectable. Standards-based. Anyone can build compatible tools
- **Built for grassroots**: DIY shows, community workshops, artist talks, neighborhood gatherings—the events that make culture alive
- **Organized, not controlled**: The togather Foundation grows the ecosystem; no single company owns it


## How It Works

**Three interconnected layers:**

<div class="layers">
<div class="layer">

**1. Data Production & Collection**

Open standards and tools for publishing event information—from institutional calendars to grassroots sites to physical posters.

<div class="layer">

**2. Data Storage & Retrieval**

A Shared Event Library: community-owned, federated infrastructure. No vendor lock-in. No surveillance.

</div>
<div class="layer">

**3. Applications & Agents**

Personal AI curators, calendar assistants, neighborhood discovery apps—all built on the same open foundation.

## What's Next

We're at the beginning. The protocols are being drafted. The first curators are being built. The ecosystem is taking shape.
