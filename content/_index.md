# Local Culture Deserves Better Infrastructure

Events are scattered across incompatible platforms. Organizers are exhausted. Communities can't coordinate themselves.

We're building **togather**: open, community-owned infrastructure that helps people discover gatherings and grassroots organizers reach their audiences—without selling their data or extracting their attention.

## The Problem

Local culture is **invisible**. Not because it doesn't exist, but because it's fragmented:

<ul class="no-checkmarks">

- 🎭 Art shows on Instagram, workshops on email lists, gatherings on Discord
- 😫 Organizers spend hours cross-posting to reach anyone
- 🏛️ Communities can't see or coordinate themselves
- 💰 Platforms extract value while contributing nothing

</ul>

**Discovery is broken. Infrastructure is missing.**

## Our Opportunity

We're at an inflection point. AI agents are emerging as personal assistants that can help people discover, evaluate, and plan events—working for individuals rather than platforms. For the first time, it's possible to build infrastructure where discovery happens *locally*, guided by personal curators that learn what matters to you, rather than algorithms optimizing for engagement and ads.

This changes everything. What if event discovery worked like the internet *should*?

- **Personal AI curators**: Agents that learn your taste, coordinate with your calendar, and surface events you'd actually love
- **No platform lock-in**: Publish once, appear everywhere (calendar apps, websites, feeds, your audience's inbox)
- **Privacy by default**: Personal curators run locally or through trusted instances. No tracking, no profiling
- **Open and improvable**: All code is inspectable. Standards-based. Anyone can build compatible tools
- **Built for grassroots**: DIY shows, community workshops, artist talks, neighborhood gatherings—the events that make culture alive
- **Organized, not controlled**: The togather Foundation coordinates the ecosystem; no single company owns it

## For Partners & Builders

### Ecosystem Partners

**Arts & Culture Organizations**: Align your metadata and discovery efforts with ours.

**Startup Founders**: Build discovery apps, calendar tools, or community platforms on shared, open infrastructure.

**Civic Tech Practitioners**: Help rebuild cultural coordination as public infrastructure.

**Organizers & Venues**: Publish once, reach everywhere—no algorithm deciding who sees you.

### Individual Hackers

Scratch your own itch:

- Build a better concert finder
- Create a neighborhood event digest  
- Write a Discord bot that pulls from shared event data
- Integrate privacy-first AI curation
- Design tools for underserved communities

## How It Works

**Three interconnected layers:**

<div class="layers">
<div class="layer">

**1. Data Production & Collection**

Open standards and tools for publishing event information—from institutional calendars to grassroots sites to physical posters.

<div class="layer">

**2. Data Storage & Retrieval**

A Shared Event Library: community-owned, federated infrastructure. No vendor lock-in. No surveillance.

</div>
<div class="layer">

**3. Applications & Agents**

Personal AI curators, calendar assistants, neighborhood discovery apps—all built on the same open foundation.

## The Difference

- **No single company controls it.** Built by cooperatives, civic tech practitioners, and local groups.

- **Privacy-first.** Your curator runs locally. Your data stays with you.

- **Works with what exists.** Email lists, calendars, websites, group chats—we strengthen them, don't replace them.

- **Open source & transparent.** All code is inspectable and forkable.

- **Built for small events.** We start with DIY shows, not just big venues.

- **Bring your own AI.** Modular. Swappable. Serve communities, not platforms.

## What's Next

We're at the beginning. The protocols are being drafted. The first curators are being built. The ecosystem is taking shape.
