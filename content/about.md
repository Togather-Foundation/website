The **Togather Foundation** is building open, community-owned infrastructure for event discovery—because local culture deserves better than extractive platforms.

## Our Story

Togather was founded in Toronto by a group of artists, hackers, and community builders who saw an opportunity: agentic AI could reshape how people discover events and dramatically improve the situation for audiences and organizers alike. We started as a grassroots effort to turn that vision into reality.

## Our Mission

We're rebuilding event discovery as a public good. A world where:

- **People** discover events that matter to them without surveillance or algorithmic manipulation
- **Organizers** reach their audiences directly, owning their relationship with attendees
- **Communities** can see and coordinate themselves
- **Developers** build innovative tools on shared, open infrastructure
- **Cities** thrive with cultural coordination that doesn't depend on corporate platforms

## Why This Matters

Events are the heartbeat of local culture. They happen everywhere—in living rooms, parks, galleries, community centers, and streets. But discovery is broken. Most events never reach the people who'd love them because they're scattered across incompatible platforms, buried in algorithms, or announced only through channels people don't follow.

Organizers respond by exhausting themselves cross-posting to Facebook, Instagram, email lists, Discord, Eventbrite, and personal websites. Communities can't coordinate themselves because there's no shared infrastructure. And platforms extract massive value—monetizing attention while contributing nothing to culture.

**We can do better.** We can build infrastructure that serves communities instead of extracting from them.

## How We Work

**Togather coordinates an ecosystem**, not a platform. We:

- Advocate for open standards (Schema.org, iCalendar, ActivityPub) so data flows freely
- Build reference implementations that prove the model works
- Support aligned projects and practitioners
- Educate and communicate about the opportunity
- Stay neutral and transparent in our role

We don't own the data. We don't control the apps. We don't monetize the community. We're here to make it easier for everyone else to build better.
