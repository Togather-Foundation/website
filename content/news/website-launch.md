We're thrilled to announce the launch of the Togather Foundation website! 

This is our digital home—a place where we share our vision for community-owned event discovery infrastructure, connect with potential ecosystem partners, and coordinate the next phase of development.

## What You'll Find Here

**[The Vision]({{< relref "/ecosystem" >}})** — A detailed look at our three-layer architecture, the opportunity in community-owned event discovery, and why now is the time to build this.

**[Latest Updates]({{< relref "/news" >}})** — News, announcements, and invitations to get involved.

## What's Next

We're actively building the foundation for open, privacy-first event discovery. If you're interested in:

- Building discovery tools or applications on shared infrastructure
- Publishing event data in standardized formats
- Creating AI-powered personal curators
- Supporting grassroots event culture

**[Get in touch](mailto:info@togather.foundation)** — we'd love to talk.

The infrastructure is being designed now. The first implementations are underway. And the ecosystem is taking shape. Come build with us.
