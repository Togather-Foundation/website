Local culture is invisible—not because it doesn't exist, but because it's scattered across incompatible platforms. **Togather** is building an open ecosystem for community connection—one that treats event discovery as a public good, not a profit center.

## The Opportunity

Events, workshops, gatherings, and community initiatives are announced on Facebook, Instagram, Eventbrite, Discord, mailing lists, posters, and hundreds of independent websites. This fragmentation creates simultaneous problems:

- **Discovery is broken**: People miss events they'd love because they don't know where to look
- **Organizers are exhausted**: Grassroots groups spend hours cross-posting to reach anyone
- **Communities are isolated**: Without shared infrastructure, neighborhoods can't coordinate themselves
- **Platforms extract value**: Corporate intermediaries monetize attention while contributing nothing to local culture

But there's an emerging solution: **AI agents that work for individuals, not platforms**. These agents can gather distributed data, learn preferences, coordinate across calendars, and surface what matters—while keeping control and privacy with people rather than corporations.

**We have a chance to rebuild cultural discovery as shared civic infrastructure.**

## Our Vision

Togather is establishing the **Togather Foundation** to coordinate three interconnected layers:

### 1. Data Production & Collection

Open standards and tools for creating, publishing, and aggregating event information from any source—institutional calendars, grassroots sites, legacy platforms, and physical posters.

**Examples:**
- Schema.org event markup for venues and organizers
- iCalendar feeds for publishing
- API standards for aggregation
- Tools for converting existing data sources

### 2. Data Storage & Retrieval

A **Shared Event Library**: community-owned, federated infrastructure that makes event data accessible without platform lock-in or surveillance.

**Key features:**
- Open data standards (no proprietary formats)
- Federated architecture (anyone can run an instance)
- Full-text search and filtering
- RESTful and ActivityPub interfaces
- Webhooks for real-time updates
- Privacy-respecting metadata

### 3. Applications & Agentic Experiences

Personal AI curators, calendar assistants, neighborhood discovery apps, and coordination tools—all built on the same open foundation, competing on quality rather than data monopolies.

**Powered by:**
- Local-first ML models
- Swappable AI backends (bring your own models)
- User-controlled preference learning
- Calendar integrations (Apple, Google, Outlook)
- Push/SMS/email notifications
- Web and mobile apps

**No single company controls it. No ads. No extraction. Just infrastructure that helps cities coordinate themselves.**

## What Makes This Different

### Community-Owned, Not Platform-Controlled

Built by cooperatives, local groups, and civic tech practitioners—not venture-backed startups optimizing for extraction.

**Why it matters:** Incentives are aligned with the community. Decisions are made transparently, with input from organizers, users, and the ecosystem.

### Privacy-First by Design

Your curator runs locally or through a trusted instance. Your preferences, calendar, and social graph stay with you. No tracking. No profiling.

**In practice:**
- Curators can run entirely on-device
- Or use community-hosted instances you trust
- Event data is served without surveillance
- Your preference model stays private
- No third-party tracking

### Works With What Already Exists

We strengthen email lists, calendars, websites, and group chats—we don't replace them. Events published through togather appear everywhere they need to go: ICS feeds, ActivityPub streams, legacy platforms, and custom apps.

**Integration points:**
- Publish via API, web form, email, or mobile app
- Syndicate to other platforms automatically
- Embed discovery widgets on your website
- Connect to existing CMS platforms
- Push to Fediverse, RSS, email newsletters

### Open Source & Transparent

All code is inspectable, forkable, and improvable. Open standards mean anyone can build compatible tools. No black-box algorithms.

**What's open:**
- Reference curator implementation
- Event library server
- Publishing tools
- Data standards and schemas
- API specifications

### Built for the Smallest Events First

The DIY shows, community workshops, artist talks, and neighborhood gatherings that make culture alive—not just big commercial venues.

**Why this matters:** Most events *aren't* on Eventbrite. They're announced on Instagram Stories, email lists, and posters. Togather reaches them.

### Bring Your Own AI

The system is modular. Swap models, tune algorithms, or write your own rules. AI should serve communities, not the other way around.

**Examples:**
- Train your own recommendation model
- Use open-source ML (no proprietary API required)
- Mix multiple models
- Write deterministic rules
- Integrate with other tools

## How It Works in Practice

### For Individuals

- Get a **personal event curator** that learns what you care about
- Discover events from across the web, aggregated in one place
- Coordinate with friends without exposing your whole calendar
- Receive suggestions via feed, newsletter, or calendar—ad-free
- Export your events anywhere

### For Organizers & Venues

- **Publish once, appear everywhere**: Create an event and push it to websites, calendars, Fediverse, email lists, and legacy platforms
- Own your audience without renting access from platforms
- Reach people looking for exactly what you do—not just who the algorithm favors
- Access analytics without selling attendee data
- Integrate ticketing, registration, and notifications

### For Developers & Builders

- **Open source, open data**: All code is documented and standards-based
- Build apps on the Shared Event Library—for free
- Integrate privacy-first ML models to improve discovery
- Fork the curator, extend the protocol, or build entirely new experiences
- Monetize through services, not data extraction

## The Foundation's Role

The **Togather Foundation** serves as **ecosystem coordinator**, not platform owner.

### Advocate for Standards

Promote common standards (Schema.org events, iCalendar, ActivityPub) so data producers and consumers can interoperate without intermediaries.

### Coordinate Projects

Align initiatives across the ecosystem—from event aggregators to calendar apps to venue management tools—so they strengthen each other rather than fragment.

### Educate & Communicate

Demonstrate the prosocial impact of shared infrastructure, help communities adopt these tools, and make the opportunity legible to funders, policymakers, and practitioners.

### Build Core Tools

Develop reference implementations (curators, aggregators, publishing tools) that prove the model works and invite others to improve on them.

## Who We're Looking For

### Arts & Culture Data Allies

Organizations working on open cultural data, event metadata standards, or community calendars. Let's align our efforts.

### Startup Founders & Developers

Teams building discovery apps, calendar tools, or community platforms. Build on our shared infrastructure instead of reinventing the data layer.

### Individual Hackers & Makers

People who want to scratch their own itch—whether that's a better concert finder, a neighborhood event digest, or a Discord bot that pulls from the shared library.

### Civic Tech Practitioners

Those working on digital public infrastructure, cooperative technology, or local government innovation. This is infrastructure for thriving cities.

### Organizers & Venue Operators

Grassroots spaces, artist-run venues, and community groups tired of cross-posting. Help us design tools that actually serve your needs.

### Funders & Institutional Partners

Foundations, municipal innovation programs, and mission-aligned investors who understand that cultural infrastructure is civic infrastructure.

## Outcomes We Enable

✅ **Individuals** discover community events through personalized, privacy-respecting experiences—without platform lock-in

✅ **Organizers** publish once and reach audiences everywhere, without ads or algorithmic suppression

✅ **Developers** build innovative applications on shared, open infrastructure instead of siloed datasets

✅ **Communities** see and coordinate themselves—making neighborhoods more connected and culture more visible

✅ **Cities** support local gathering without relying on extractive corporate platforms

## Get Involved

We're at the beginning. The protocols are being drafted. The first curators are being built. The ecosystem is taking shape.

**If this resonates—if you see the opportunity, have complementary expertise, or just want to help make this real—let's talk.**
